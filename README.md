# CNN-vs-VIT

Comparative Study of CNN and Vision Transformer (ViT) Models for Image Classification on the Fruits 360 Dataset

This research aims to compare the performance of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification using the Fruits-360 dataset. The study evaluates these architectures based on accuracy, precision, recall, and computational efficiency while exploring the impact of freezing pre-trained ViT layers during fine-tuning. By analyzing their strengths, limitations, and practical applicability, this work provides insights into developing robust and efficient fruit classification systems for industrial applications.
